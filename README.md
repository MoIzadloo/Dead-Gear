### Dead Gear
Your journey begins in a humble beat-up car, weaving through a maze of speeding cars and trucks. As you navigate the chaotic streets, earn points and collect coins to upgrade your vehicle, transforming it from a rusty relic into a high-performance police cruiser.

With your police cruiser's enhanced speed and maneuverability, you'll dominate the road, dodging obstacles and pursuing high-speed chases. But that's not all â€“ your arsenal expands to include a potent freeze ray, allowing you to temporarily halt time and plan your next move with precision.

As you progress, the challenges intensify, and your vehicle undergoes a final metamorphosis into an unstoppable tank. Armed with powerful rockets, you'll blast your way through the traffic, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake.

Your ultimate goal is to achieve the coveted 3,000-point milestone, a testament to your driving skills and unwavering determination. Dead Gear is a thrilling test of reflexes and strategy, where every decision and maneuver matters. So, get ready to hit the gas and experience the exhilaration of Dead Gear!
